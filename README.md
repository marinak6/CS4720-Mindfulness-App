# CS4720-Mindfulness-App

The Mindfulness App will provide a new way for people to journal about their daily events and feelings. Rather than the classic way of writing out their entries, Mindfulness App will allow people to record their entries in multiple ways such as images, writings, and entering location. The app also serves as an organization tool for managing wellbeing and your emotions.
